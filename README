Program made for TP-LINK TD-W8968
work with other models? Probably not.

I created this program to fix this issue:
 Frequently my WAN connection of ADSL router
 goes down, and not reconnect. I tried to use
 the last version of router firmware but it
 doesn't work. Also, sometimes the status
 of WAN is Connected, but it isn't (ISP problem?).

This program check if have internet access,
if not, it do commands in the router to
connect/reconnect WAN interface. These commands
you can do using a web interface, this program
automatize this.

The best way to use this program is with Cron.

Configurations are in config.py


Requirements:
 python-chardet
 python-six
 python-beautifulsoup
 python-requests (>=2.2.1)
